## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Overlay
- Position
- Transform
- Margin and Padding
- Hover atattribute

### Continued development

In this project i've found some attributes I didn't learned before, like Overlay, transition and opacity. Position and display got me stuck for a while too.
However I think did very well with the resources I know and I've been able to succesfully research the contents I had no acknowledge. The code is far from perfect or clean but i'm happy that I managed to completed it without many struggles :P
